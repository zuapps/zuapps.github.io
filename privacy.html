                <p><strong>Security</strong>. We have implemented appropriate technical, organizational and security
                    measures designed to reduce the risk of accidental destruction or loss, or the unauthorized
                    disclosure or access to such information appropriate to the nature of the information concerned.
                    However, please note that we cannot guarantee that the information will not be exposed as a result
                    of unauthorized penetration to our servers. As the security of information depends in part on the
                    security of the computer, device or network you use to communicate with us and the security you use
                    to protect your user IDs and passwords, please make sure to take appropriate measures to protect
                    this information.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><strong>Retention of your Personal Data</strong>. In addition to the retention periods mentioned in
                    Section 1 above, in some circumstances we may store your Personal Data for longer periods of time,
                    for example (i) where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax or
                    accounting requirements, or (ii) for us to have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the
                    event of any complaints or challenges, or (iii) if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of
                    litigation relating to your Personal Data or dealings.</p>


                <h2>3. How we share your personal data</h2>

                <h2>4. Additional information regarding transfers of personal data</h2>
                <p>Access from Israel is covered by the Adequacy Decision issued by the European Commission about
                    Israel, where it stated that Israel is a jurisdiction that provides adequate level of data

                <p>External transfers: Where we transfer your Personal Data outside of Zu-Apps, for example to third
                    parties mentioned in Section 1 above, we will do so in accordance with the applicable law while we
                    will obtain contractual commitments from them to protect your Personal Data. To the extent that you
                    are protected under the GDPR, we bring to your attention that some of these assurances are well
                    recognized certification schemes like the EU - US Privacy Shield for the protection of Personal Data
                    transferred from within the EU to the United States. In addition, we bring to your attention that
                    Israel is a country declared as offering adequate level of data protection (see here: <a

                </p>
                <p>Where we receive requests for Personal Data from law enforcement or regulators, we carefully validate
                    these requests before any Personal Data is disclosed.</p>
